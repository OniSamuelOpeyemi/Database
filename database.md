 *Databases are essential for storing and managing data. This course covers the fundamentals of databases, including various data types and specific database services like Amazon RDS and DynamoDB. The final task involves a practical application of these concepts by setting up a private server and connecting it to an RDS database. üíæ*

## Introduction to Databases ##
A database is an organized collection of data, typically stored electronically. Databases can be categorized by their structure:

**Structured Data**: This is data that adheres to a predefined model, often stored in tabular formats with rows and columns. Examples include relational databases like MySQL or PostgreSQL. This data is easy to query and analyze. üìà

**Semi-structured Data**: This data does not conform to the strict tabular structure of a relational database but still contains tags or markers to separate and identify elements. Examples include JSON or XML files. The structure is not rigid but offers a clear hierarchy.  üìÇ

**Unstructured Data**: This data has no predefined format or organization. Examples include text documents, emails, audio files, and images. While it's the most common type of data, it is also the most difficult to query and analyze. üñºÔ∏è

- **SQL (Structure Query Language)** - It's a domain-specific language designed for managing relational database management system (RDBMS). It is the standard language used to interact with these databases, allowing users to perform various operations on data stored in a structured, tabular format. It is specifically designed for relational database which arranges data into tables consisting of row (records or tuples) and column (attribute or field). (It operate through simple declarative statements using user-friendly syntax).

## Introduction to Amazon RDS ##
Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) is a managed service that simplifies the setup, operation, and scaling of a relational database in the cloud. It supports various database engines like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQL Server.

*Key features of RDS include:*

**Read Replicas:** These are copies of your primary database instance. You use them to handle read-heavy workloads, offloading traffic from the primary instance to improve performance and scalability. Read replicas are asynchronous, meaning there's a slight delay in data synchronization. üîÑ

**Multi-AZ Deployment:** This provides high availability and failover support by synchronously replicating your data to a standby instance in a different Availability Zone (AZ). If the primary instance fails, RDS automatically switches to the standby instance.

## Introduction to DynamoDB ##
Amazon DynamoDB is a fully managed, serverless, NoSQL database service. It is designed for applications that require single-digit millisecond latency at any scale. Unlike RDS, which is relational, DynamoDB is a key-value and document database. üöÄ

*Core DynamoDB concepts include:*

**Tables:** A collection of data, similar to a table in a relational database.

**Items:** A collection of attributes, similar to a row in a relational database.

**Partition Key and Sort Key:** Together, these form the primary key that uniquely identifies each item in a table. The partition key determines the physical storage location of the data, while the sort key determines the order of items within the partition. Using both allows for more flexible querying.

**Time-to-Live (TTL):** This feature allows you to automatically delete items from your table after a specified period, which helps manage data and reduce storage costs. ‚è≥

**Global Secondary Indexes (GSI):** These are indexes on attributes other than the primary key. They allow for efficient queries on non-key attributes. A GSI has its own partition and sort key, which can be different from the base table.

**Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR):** This provides continuous backups of your DynamoDB tables, allowing you to restore the table to any point in time within the last 35 days. üï∞Ô∏è

**DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX):** This is an in-memory cache for DynamoDB. It provides fast read performance for millions of requests per second, reducing the load on your DynamoDB tables. üèéÔ∏è
